                                  HOME

Welcome to my `$HOME`.

§ HOME STRUCTURE

The contents of my `$HOME` directory are listed below.

~/files/.
Where I archive documents, media, and files for consumption.  Each
category of files has a subdirectory in it.  For example, `~/files/doc/`
is for non-fiction books; `~/files/lit/` is for fiction books;
`~/files/meme/` is the meme folder; `~/files/mus/` is the music folder;
etc.

~/proj/.
Where I put whatever I am working on (mostly college stuff, things I am
learning, and programs I write).  Each project has a subdirectory in it.
For example, `~/proj/xmenu/` for `xmenu(1)`; `~/proj/c/` for notes on
the C Programming Language; etc.

~/rules/.
Configuration files (aka dotfiles).  For example, `~/rules/vimrc` (for
`vim(1)`).

~/skel/.
Skeleton files, that is, templates for different file formats.  For
example, `~/skel/Makefile` is a template for a Makefile; `~/skel/man.1`
is a template for a section 1 man page; etc.

~/theme/.
Where I keep icons, cursors, fonts, etc.

~/tmp/.
Download directory and where I dump stuff.  I try to keep it clean, but
most of the time it is a mess.

~/usr/.
Program files (binaries, sources, manuals, etc).  Each subdirectory
contain files installed from a given source or using a given method.
For example, `~/usr/local/` contains data for programs I install
manually; `~/usr/python/` is for programs installed with `pip(1)`;
`~/usr/go/` is for programs installed with `go(1)`; etc.  Each
subdirectory contains the directories `bin/`, `src/`, and `man/` (for
binaries, source and manual).  For example, `~/usr/go/bin/lf` is the
binary for lf installed by go(1); `~/usr/local/man/man1/xmenu.1` is the
manual for xmenu(1) installed by its Makefile; etc.

~/var/.
Files that are not managed manually, but by applications.
`~/var/trash/` is for trashed files managed by `trash(1)` and
`untrash(1)`; `~/var/mail/` is for email managed by `mutt(1)`,
`mbsync(1)` and others; `~/var/history/` is for command history from
`ksh(1)`, `xprompt(1)` and others; `~/var/cache/` is for cache used and
generated by several programs.
