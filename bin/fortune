All governments lie.
Any interesting program has at least: one loop; one I/O statement; and one bug.
GNOME does not care about your experience or convenience. They care about Allan Day's acid trip ideas and Red Hat money.

An assault on large problems employs a succession of programs, most of which spring into existance in course.	-- Abelson & Sussman, SICP
Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers.  As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.	-- Abelson & Sussman, SICP
Educators, generals, dieticians, psychologists, and parents program.  Armies, students, and some societies are programmed.	-- Abelson & Sussman, SICP
Every computer program is a model, hatched in the mind, of a real or mental process. These processes, arising from human experience and thought, are huge in number, intricate in detail, and at any time only partially understood. They are modeled to our permanent satisfaction rarely by our computer programs.	-- Abelson & Sussman, SICP
Expert programmers know how to choose the level of abstraction appropriate to their task.	-- Abelson & Sussman, SICP
Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “what is.” Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how to”
Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.	-- Abelson & Sussman, SICP
The programmer must seek both perfection of part and adequacy of collection.	-- Abelson & Sussman, SICP
Unfortunately, as programs get large and complicated, as they almost always do, the adequacy, consistency, and correctness of the specifications themselves become open to doubt, so that complete formal arguments of correctness seldom accompany large programs.	-- Abelson & Sussman, SICP
It has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders of other giants. It has also been said that the software industry is an example of midgets standing on the toes of other midgets.	-- Alan Cooper, About Face.
Lisp programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing.	-- Alan Perlis.

Life is too short to run proprietary software.	-- Bdale Garbee.
They who can give up essential liberty for temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.	-- Benjamin Franklin.
Incorrect documentation is often worse than no documentation.	-- Bertrand Meyer.
I have always wished that my computer would be as easy to use as my telephone. My wish has come true. I no longer know how to use my telephone.	-- Bjarne Stroustrup.

Don't include a sentence in documentation if its negation is obviously false.	-- Bob Martin, AT&T Technologies.
Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.	-- Brian Kernighan.
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.  Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.	-- Brian W' Kernighan and P'J' Plauger in The Elements of.  Programming Style.
There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.	-- C'A'R' Hoare, The 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture.
Nobody who uses XML knows what they are doing.	-- Chris Wenham.
So-called “smart” software usually is the worst you can imagine.	-- Christian Neukirchen.
If you have too many special cases, you are doing it wrong.	-- Craig Zerouni
Unix is a junk OS designed by a committee of PhDs.	-- Dave Cutler.
Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology because software is so complicated. Beauty is the ultimate defence against complexity.	-- David Gelernter.
Get your data structures correct first, and the rest of the program will write itself.	-- David Jones.
If you give someone a program, you will frustrate them for a day; if you teach them how to program, you will frustrate them for a lifetime.	-- David Leinweber (NOWS).
When explaining a command, or language feature, or hardware widget, first describe the problem it is designed to solve.	-- David Martin
Compatibility means deliberately repeating other people's mistakes.	-- David Wheeler.
Unix has retarded OS research by 10 years and linux has retarded it by 20.	-- Dennis Ritchie.
I would rather write programs to help me write programs than write programs.	-- Dick Sites.
You're bound to be unhappy if you optimize everything.	-- Donald Knuth.
As a programmer, it is your job to put yourself out of business. What you do today can be automated tomorrow.	-- Doug McIlroy.
I […] am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand.	-- Douglas Adams, Last Chance to See.
The computing scientist's main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making.	-- E'W' Dijkstra.
Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.	-- Edsger W. Dijkstra.
Good judgement comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgement.	-- Fred Brooks.
Plan to throw a prototype away, you will anyhow.	-- Fred Brooks.
The central enemy of reliability is complexity.	-- Geer &al.

Deleted code is debugged code.	-- Jeff Sickel.
Revolution is the opium of the intellectuals.	-- Jerzy Peterkiewicz.
The problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.	-- Joe Armstrong.
If you're willing to restrict the flexibility of your approach, you can almost always do something better.	-- John Carmack.
One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.	-- Ken Thompson.
When in doubt, use brute force.	-- Ken Thompson.
You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself.	-- Ken Thompson.
Trying to outsmart a compiler defeats much of the purpose of using one.	-- Kernighan and Plauger, The Elements of Programming Style.
I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.	-- Linus Torvalds.
This “users are idiots, and are confused by functionality” mentality of Gnome is a disease. If you think your users are idiots, only idiots will use it.	-- Linus Torvalds.
Never let your schooling interfere with your education.	-- Mark Twain.
Software efficiency halves every 18 months, compensating Moore's Law.	-- May's Law.
Security is a state of mind.	-- NSA Security Manual.
