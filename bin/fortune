Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology because software is so complicated. Beauty is the ultimate defence against complexity.	-- David Gelernter.
Compatibility means deliberately repeating other people's mistakes.	-- David Wheeler.
Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers.  As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.	-- Abelson & Sussman, SICP
Computers make it easier to do a lot of things, but most of the things they make it easier to do don't need to be done.	-- Andy Rooney.
Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.	-- Brian Kernighan.
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.  Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.	-- Brian W' Kernighan and P'J' Plauger in The Elements of.  Programming Style.

Every computer program is a model, hatched in the mind, of a real or mental process. These processes, arising from human experience and thought, are huge in number, intricate in detail, and at any time only partially understood. They are modeled to our permanent satisfaction rarely by our computer programs.	-- Abelson & Sussman, SICP
Expert programmers know how to choose the level of abstraction appropriate to their task.	-- Abelson & Sussman, SICP

I love the comics medium.  I pretty much detest the comics industry.	-- Alan Moore (or myself if s/comics/software/g).
I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.	-- Linus Torvalds.
I would rather write programs to help me write programs than write programs.	-- Dick Sites.
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.	-- Richard Stallman
I've alerted the social credit system admins, they have temporarily degraded your rating to 2.9 stars.  You can no longer purchase food for the next 72 hours.

It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.	-- Alan Perlis.
It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.	-- Alan Perlis.
Life is too short to run proprietary software.	-- Bdale Garbee.
Like most systemd replacements for important services (ntp, dns, cron, etc) systemd-resolved is a half-arsed implementation that is only suitable for desktop machines that happen to be a lot like Lennart Poettering's desktop machine.	-- <https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/542146>
Mathematicians stand on each others' shoulders and computer scientists stand on each others' toes.	-- Richard Hamming.

There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.	-- C'A'R' Hoare, The 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture.
They who can give up essential liberty for temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.	-- Benjamin Franklin.
This “users are idiots, and are confused by functionality” mentality of Gnome is a disease. If you think your users are idiots, only idiots will use it.	-- Linus Torvalds.

Trying to outsmart a compiler defeats much of the purpose of using one.	-- Kernighan and Plauger, The Elements of Programming Style.
Unfortunately, as programs get large and complicated, as they almost always do, the adequacy, consistency, and correctness of the specifications themselves become open to doubt, so that complete formal arguments of correctness seldom accompany large programs.	-- Abelson & Sussman, SICP
Unix has retarded OS research by 10 years and linux has retarded it by 20.	-- Dennis Ritchie.
